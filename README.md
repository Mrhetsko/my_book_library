# Book Service API

A simple and robust RESTful API service built with Python and FastAPI for managing and providing access to literary works. The project is fully containerized using Docker, includes database migrations with Alembic, and has an End-to-End test suite.

## Features

-   **List & Filter**: Retrieve a list of all books with powerful filtering capabilities.
-   **Download Books**: Download a book's file by its unique ID.
-   **Denylist Functionality**: Block specific books or authors from being downloaded by uploading a simple `.xlsx` file.
-   **Online Viewer**: A simple server-rendered HTML page to view a book's content directly in the browser.
-   **Containerized**: Fully containerized with Docker and Docker Compose for easy setup and consistent deployment.
-   **Database Migrations**: Uses Alembic to reliably manage database schema changes.
-   **Tested**: Includes an E2E test suite using Pytest to ensure the API works as expected.
